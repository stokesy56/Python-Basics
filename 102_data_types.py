# Numerical Data types
# - Int, long, float, complex
#  These are numerical data types which we can use numerical operators

# Complex and long we don't use much
# COmplex can have imaginary numbers
# long - are integers of unlimited size

my_int = 10
print(my_int)
print(type(my_int))

# Operator - add, subtract, divide and multiply
# exponential

print(4 / 2)
print(5 // 2)  # keeps it a s integer/ drops decimal
print(3 * 2)
print(3 ** 2)

# Modulus % gives remainder from division of two variables
print(10 % 3)  ##gives 1 there are three 3's in 10 and 1 leftover

# Comparison operator --> outputs boolean value
# == is comparison operator
# < / > is greater/smaller than
# <= is less than or equal to
# >= is greater than or equal to
# != not equal
# is or is not
